## Welcome to Captain API

All endpoints are key-protected. Authentication is required for all API calls.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require an API key and ClientID (userID) for authentication. These parameters should be included in every request.

```json
{
  "apiKey": "your_api_key_here",
  "clientID": "your_client_id_here"
}
```
